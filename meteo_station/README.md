# Weather station

## What we need
- Arduino
- WiFI ESP module
- BME280 Sensor
- Wind Direction Indicator
- Anemometer

  ## What's going on

  This project took place in the SAE aero design competition context.
  It consists of an elaboration of a radio-controlled aero model. During the competition, we must fly it and make the airplane model accomplish some tasks.
  Once there are more or less 50 competitors, choosing the right moment to fly is essential.

  This weather station provides data to help the squad captain to decide when we can make the aero model on air.

  ##Disclaimer
  This is a project that took place in 2018, and I am trying to revive it. I had some old codes that I tried to adjust.

  My next steps are to arrange it and built the Station to test it in real-life situations. Then, I will make code corrections.
