Integration between the Zabbix tool and an ESP-01 used to collect temperature and humidity data. Data is sent to Zabbix via Zabbix Sender.

## What's going on
This project took place in 2019. We need an easy and cheap solution to check the room temperature of some data centers.
Once the access was limited and there was already a Zabbix environment running, we implemented a way that it sends the needed data via a Zabbix Sender.

### Disclaimer
I will try to rebuild the project. That said, once I rebuild it, I will adapt the code to ensure it is running well.
