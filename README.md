# My IOT projects

In this repo, I will register my personal IOT projects.

I will arrange each project in its directory.

I will explain each project's motivation and details in its own README.

On this day, I have two projects:
- Arduino meteorological station, with wifi possibilities.
- Room temperature sensor with a built-in Zabbix sender.
